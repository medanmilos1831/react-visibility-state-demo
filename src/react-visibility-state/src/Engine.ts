 * Engine class represents a visibility engine that can be turned on/off

 * allowing components to subscribe to state changes and dispatch new states.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const engine = new Engine("my-visibility-engine", ENGINE_STATE.OFF);
 *
 * // Subscribe to state changes
 * const unsubscribe = engine.subscribe(() => {
 *   console.log("Engine state changed:", engine.getState());
 * });
 *
 * // Turn on the engine
 * engine.dispatch({ value: ENGINE_STATE.ON, data: { reason: "user-action" } });
 *
 * // Cleanup
 * unsubscribe();
 * ```
